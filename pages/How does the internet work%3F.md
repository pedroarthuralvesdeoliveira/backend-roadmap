- ## What is a Network
- Is a group of computers or other devices which are connected to each other.

- At a high level, the internet works by connecting devices and computer systems together using a set of standardized protocols. These protocols define how information is exchanged between devices and ensure that data is transmitted reliably and securely.
- The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers, which are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems. When you send data over the internet, it is broken up into small packets that are sent from your device to a router. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router in the path towards its destination. This process continues until the packet reaches its final destination.
